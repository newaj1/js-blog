            Qus-1: What is the difference between local storage and session storage <br> <br>
            Ans: "sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
            expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends."

            Qus-2: What is the difference between global scope and block scope <br> <br>
            Ans:Global Scope
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
            global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
            function or conditional state can access that variable. <br>
            Block Scope
            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
            something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

            Qus-3: How javascript event loop works <br> <br>
            Ans: The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.
            Thus event loop works in a cyclic manner, where it continually checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.
